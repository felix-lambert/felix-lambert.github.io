<p>Fun is maybe imposing yourself some rules that are not really needed, that you can play with. Sometimes it could be fun to remain completely anonymous on the web, to configure the computer like Stallman is configuring his, even if it’s for ideological reasons. My guess is that Richard Stallman is doing this because he thinks it’s fun. Maybe we don’t really need to find other reasons.</p>

<p>I’m giving myself tons of rules. Sometimes it could be for my productivity (succeeding in life, in my professional career I guess, or even having some kind of level of recognition). Or I could even give myself a rule to decide to avoid all things linked to productivity. If we decide to have fun and play with all the world in front of us, we can make peace with all the things that are around us.</p>

<p><em>“We are obsessed with freedom, but we are also miserable and bored, despite living in an era of enormous
surplus. Instead of seeing freedom as an escape from the chains of limitation, we should interpret it as an
opportunity to explore the implications of inherited or invented limitations.”</em> Bogost</p>

<p>If we’re completely free, we can’t have fun because we don’t have boundaries. Personal rules can create an environment of playground where fun is possible.</p>

<p>Fun can also be a way to change the world: it could be fun to all leave facebook, instagram, the media, without any political reason behind. It could be fun to decide to avoid all the advertisements, the speech of a politician, and see each day how good we are at doing this. It could be fun to become a wise person not running for power. We can do these things just for the fun of it because we love testing ourselves by exploring new ways of behaving in the world.</p>
