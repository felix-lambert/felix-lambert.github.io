  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83FbAKf7wUQ&amp;t=327s">Play anything</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html">Do not show yourself on the web</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Fun is maybe doing stuff where you impose yourself some rules that are not really needed, where you can play with. Sometimes it could be fun to decide to completely obey your partner: you can decide to do everything to respect her will and do everything to not make her becoming angry. It could be fun to really decide to respect an other human being, to decide to remain completely anonymous on the web, to configure the computer like Stallman is configuring his, even if it’s for ideological reason. My guess is that Richard Stallman is doing this because he thinks it’s fun doing this, and maybe we don’t really need to find other reason than this. We can sometimes decide to obey completely to an authority, or, the next day, to decide disobeying it, if you judge that his level of control is getting too irrational.</p>

<p>I’m giving myself tons of rules. Sometimes it could be for my productivity (succeeding in life, in my professionnal career I guess, or even having some kind of level or recognition). Other times, I just decide to tidy my kitchen as slowly as possible, by doing tai chi. Maybe I don’t really need to do this for spiritual reason. Maybe I could just choose to do this for fun. Or I could even give myself a rule to decide to avoid all things that are linked to productivity. I wonder if we decide to have fun with all the world in front of us, we can at the same time decide to make peace with all the things that are around us.</p>

<p>But what is interesting is that the notion of fun is not the same notion as the notion of freedom. Maybe if we are completely free, we can’t have fun because we don’t have, any boundaries, any rules that can create in front of you an environment of playground where fun is possible.</p>

<p>Fun can be also a way to change the world: it could be fun to all leave facebook, instagram, the media, without any political reason behind. It could be fun to decide to avoid all the advertisements, the speech of a politician, and see each day how good you are in doing this. It could be fun to become a wise person not running for power. We can do these kind of things just for the fun of it because we love testing ourselves by exploring new ways of behaving in the world.</p>
