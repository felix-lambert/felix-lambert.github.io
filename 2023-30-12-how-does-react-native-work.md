In a vast digital realm, there were two bustling towns: JavaScript Town, known for its nimble and versatile scripts, and Native Town, a place where the robust and powerful languages like Kotlin and Swift were spoken. For years, these towns had a unique way of exchanging information, known as The Bridge.

The Bridge was a grand structure, built by skilled engineers using the sturdy materials of C/C++. It served as the only route for messages between the two towns. When a resident of JavaScript Town needed something from Native Town – say, to access the phone's camera or GPS – they would write a detailed request in their script, which was then sent across The Bridge.

In Native Town, skilled translators would decode these scripts and turn them into actions. The responses would then make the return journey over The Bridge back to JavaScript Town. This system, while reliable, was like sending letters by courier – it got the job done but wasn’t the fastest.

One day, a new path was discovered, called Fabric.

With Fabric, JavaScript Town could directly communicate with Native Town without the lengthy process of sending messages back and forth over The Bridge. Now, a script from JavaScript Town could directly invoke functions in Native Town. For example, a JavaScript script could directly activate a Kotlin function in Native Town, almost as if it were a native JavaScript function.

This direct communication was made possible by a magical innovation known as JSI – JavaScript Interface. JSI was like a universal translator, instantly converting the scripts of JavaScript Town into the languages of Native Town, and vice versa. It allowed for seamless interaction, making the process much faster and more efficient.
