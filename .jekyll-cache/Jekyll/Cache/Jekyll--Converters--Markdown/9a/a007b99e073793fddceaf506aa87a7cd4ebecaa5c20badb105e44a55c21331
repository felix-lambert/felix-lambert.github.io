<p>Maybe in our culture nostalgia is a real problem for building the future. We tend to idealize the 80s or the 90s for example and have some kind of romantic fascination of the past. And probably, in the future weâ€™ll idealize today. Maybe this is a symptom showing how much we have trouble appreciating the present. But we have everything today: we can easily connect with each other and have conversations with anybody, available to listen. We can access all the culture of the world for free to build ourselves as individuals. We basically have all the necessary tools for building new projects. So why coming back to the past? Why do we sometimes have this feeling of nostalgia?</p>

<p>Ian Bogost is wondering why we donâ€™t have the same level of fascination of the objects of today as the objects of the 70s or the 80s. Isnâ€™t the personnal computer an amazing tool? The internet box or the game console, motivating you for your fitness is actually really important for us and beautiful. Or your smartphone with all the apps that are helping you daily getting better is maybe the tool as important as the light bulb or the printer.</p>
