I"€<p>Itâ€™s accepted to say that in the buddhist tradition we all have a potential buddha inside of us. I wonder if we cannot say the same thing for things. Maybe a nice game could be to discover only the good sides of an other human being, discover the buddha inside of them. We can also realize that things can have some ethics too: if you listen well to a table, itâ€™s here to be cleaned sometimes, and to have some nice food prepared on top of it. If you see a shower and soap, itâ€™s here to be used well. The soap is telling you to wash yourself properly and all the cleaning products are telling you to clean your house. 
Maybe a good way of solving the global problems of the world is eventually disposing things the right way, in the right order. If we listen to things, we can see the ethics inside of them and by seeing the ethics inside of them, you can use them in the right way.</p>
