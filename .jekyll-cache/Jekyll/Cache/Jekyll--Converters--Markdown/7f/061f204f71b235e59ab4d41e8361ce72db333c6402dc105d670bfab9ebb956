<p>When companies want to hire new software developers, they now more focus on empathy skills than technical skills, or at least they should do. This is why software developers need to take empathy very seriously: if you‚Äôre an amazing developer but you don‚Äôt know how to work in a group and communicate clearly and with benevolence, you will not provide psychological safety to the group which is the most important thing to have if you want to feel good in an environment and be productive.</p>

<p>So all the words we use should be chosen very precisely. The way we ask something, we need to make sure that others did get it and didn‚Äôt feel ofended by the way you‚Äôre asking this task. It‚Äôs a real work that requires training, and it‚Äôs even more important for me than good quality code. If you have good quality code but bad communication, the good quality code becomes useless because good quality code is good communication. In other words, code, oral or written communication have the same goal: to communicate to somebody else by making sure that the output you provide is well understood and interpreted by the receiver of this output.</p>

<p>Actually, this is why we shouldn‚Äôt even use the ‚ÄúGood code‚Äù or ‚ÄúBad code‚Äù. Because ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù have a moral implication that could easily come with a feeling of guilt. We should maybe say instead: a code that is easily readable or not easily readible. So when we see a code that is complicated to read, to harmonize with this code, you can provide clear and benevolent communication.</p>

<p>Other ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a software developer should work on his empathy skills and his technical skills</li>
  <li>an advanced software needs more than one developer.</li>
