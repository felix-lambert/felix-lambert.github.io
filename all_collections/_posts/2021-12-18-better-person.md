One interesting thing that we could do is to wake up every morning and read about a word and its concept that fit your values. It could be friendship or courage. It could be kindness or peace. Whatever you want.

When you manage to find a word that is important to you, see how a philosopher, a writer or a poet has defined this word and try to keep this definition in your head during the whole day. The next day, you can do it with another word. One day it could be peace, and another day it could be courage. You can even try to incorporate the meaning of the word into your day. What can I do to bring peace in the environment I'm around? What action requires a bit of courage today?
