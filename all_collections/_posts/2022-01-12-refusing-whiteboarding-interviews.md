During my career as a programmer, I've gotten rejected 3 times because of whiteboarding. Whiteboarding is a situation during a process of a job interview where you're put into a situation to solve abstract algorithm problems into a whiteboard. Livecoding is a very similar method for me: you share your coding editor and you solve "live" abstract algorithm problems without being able to check on google.
 
To solve these algorithms, you need a few weeks of training. Websites like hackerrank help you. You lose your time in doing stuff that you will never do in your actual job. If a candidate did something quite cool before, or is quite original in his ideas, if he fails the whiteboarding he will simply not get the job. Maybe a company like Google needs to find a way to filter their candidates by doing whiteboarding because it's a fast process. I would like to challenge this idea because it actually takes some time to organize the whiteboarding interview process, and it could be quite fast to simply see their old coding repo, check a work to do from home, or simply a situation of pair programming where you are put into the actual work environment solving real stuff; stuffs that are actually useful for the company.
 
The world of tech should not be limited to people solving fast abstract mathematical problems. This practice should change if we want real diversity in a tech team with people thinking differently. We maybe need an engineer, but we also need someone with creativity and imagination (even if I know that an engineer can have creativity and imagination), that has a good vision of what could be the end goal of a project. I'm not saying that we need to hire people with no technical skills. I'm saying that the technical skills of a programmer is not limited to an engineer being able to do good math or statistics.
 
I also think that whiteboarding interviews could be seen as a right of passage into the tech world and it's cultural. It's a form of submission that you need to go through. So even if it's useless for the job in solving abstract maths and statistics you still need to do this week of training. The one disciplined enough to follow this ritual will get the job. This process could also prove that the organization of the company is vertical (top-down).
 
This is why I've decided to only work for companies that do not do whiteboarding interviews.
