With my EmptyMyFridge project I hate doing the effort of contacting infestors so that they can listen and get attention of me and prove that I can predict the future. With my very short experience of it, I have been rejected, because I did'nt follow well the superticious rituals of the buziness plan.

So I've decided not to do so. I'm lucky of having money aside and have the skills of building EmptyMyFridge. I want to see some real action instead of money. 

But globally... Why are nation states asks for more money? Why investors only gives value to a confident man? Why can't we be humble enough to just decide to live with what we have?

I don't have any answer to this and would be very happy to hear some new ideas, outside of global denounciation of capitalism.
