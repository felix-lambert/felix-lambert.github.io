Google enables Android users to increase the accessibility for Android users who experience disabilities. Since many users with disabilities have unique needs, Android's APIs for creating accessibility services are open, and developers are free to create and distribute their own services through the Play Store.

Some examples:

Switch Access > lets you interact with your Android device using one or more switches instead of the touchscreen. You can use an external switch, an external keyboard or the buttons (such as the volume up and volume down buttons) of your android device. 

Voice Access > lets you control your device with spoken commands

Talkback > speaks text and image content on your screen

The ability for you to build and deploy accessibility services was introduced with Android 1.6 (API Level 4) in 2009 and received significant improvements with Android 4.0 (API Level 14) in 2011.
