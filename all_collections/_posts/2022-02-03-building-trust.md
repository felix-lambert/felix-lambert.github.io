We need to pay attention here to all the behaviors that are helping us in building a civilization of trust or knowledge. 

Promising us something, being coherent with what we say, but not actually realizing this promise is lowering the global level of trust. So a lot of politicians are not helping us there. If we keep not respecting what we're telling to others, we are destroying the culture of trust. 

The digital age gives us the possibility to share all our feelings and thoughts with humanity. I think we should celebrate this evolution: people are not insecure to share their ideas and photos or videos to the world, and often for free. So gathering billions of data is not really a problem if in return companies can provide constructive help to all of us.

The problem comes when in exchange a company like facebook uses this data so that they receive money from private companies that try to model us and manipulate us with publicity or by rigging an election. These actions are lowering the global level of trust in the society.

Maybe we could focus more on trust than security. The idea is to first trust others and maybe, if there is a mistake, to see what we can learn from it, and be more careful by not completely neglecting security. Security could come after a mistake not before.
