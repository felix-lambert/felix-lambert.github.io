It's really difficult to find thinkers defending new technologies of today. They seem to not notice that technology offers a huge service for humans. Even with thinkers I really appreciate, they nearly always end up saying that technology, with capitalism I suppose, will, by one way or another, end up destroying humanity. It's always the same kind of love song.

The technology is now part of us. It's part of our humanity. And it's through these technologies that we can act in the world. So the problem is not AI, it is questioning what is the end goal of AI for example. I use AI or pseudo AI technologies every day. I'm not afraid of them if they can help me in fulfilling my project: writing good emails with no grammar mistakes, translating a paper into corean, helping us to detect potential dangers... If it's only used for ads and control, well it's a very disappointing use of AI I guess. So maybe we need to ask our intellectual friends to focus on where we need to go as a human species with all the technologies that are around us. But the difficulty is to take time in understanding first what these technologies are and to which extent they can help us building a more sustainable society with maybe a new set of cultural background.
