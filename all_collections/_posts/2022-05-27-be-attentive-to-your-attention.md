The skill of reorienting your attention could be the answer for having a fulfilled life. If we have the capacity of being careful of where our attention is focused, from waking up to sleeping, we might be able to solve all the global problems of the world.

This skill is to realize first how things work inside of you and outside. You might need to realize that you are a very sophisticated walking (with only two feets) hominid with a large brain processing a large quantity of emotional thoughts and being so influenced by these thoughts that you could end up suffering. Also today when you're interacting with a group of people or a very powerful informational machine like a smartphone your current thoughts could be modified very strongly and even end up changing who you are. Being aware of the power of a smartphone, a television or a work environment with a group of people talking and competing with each other could be a great skill and could be enough to solve difficult situations.
