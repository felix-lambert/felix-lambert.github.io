<em>"The hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of software systems to achieve novel and clever outcomes"</em>

When a new thing is coming to you, or when something needs to change, the first reaction might be resistance or blockage. Or we can admire this new thing, without any critical thinking. But we can deal with it differently. We can see if we can accept this new thing. And if it does not completely fit our values or our needs, we can hack it. So what I’m proposing is that we don’t really need to be completely against Google, video games, nation states, or capitalism… We can try to find out what we can do with those ideals, understand their core values, and behave in such ways that we can generate small change. In other words, we can hack these systems so that new opportunities can arise. Even in the world of apps, with google and Apple owning these industries, we can create new types of apps and change the goals and behavior of apps. Linux hacked computers to transform them into operating systems. The Internet and the web, hacked microsoft, and transformed the computer from an operating system to a connected device. And even in offline life, when change happens, it’s often because of something creative happening. We tend to idealize revolutions, but when real change happens, it’s often because of a new behavior with individuals that can improvise by seeing things in new ways. We can evaluate the current situation and see that new ways of relating with things and people can arise.

But how to hack?

1. Evaluate zones that are not totally blocked. So hacking politics, facebook, the nuclear industry, or closed ideologies could be a big waste of energy with a big wall with no holes facing you… What you could hack, is things that are actually open to hacking, by being aware of things that are in dynamic movement. Hacking is letting things move, with no blockage. If there is violence in the world or closed ideology, it’s because there is blockage and no movement. So hacking could be letting things move as they should move.

2. Do things differently. Do not really listen to what should be done to start a business for example, or gather users, or work, or anything else. People kept saying to google's founder to put some ads in the first page of their search engine because there would be no way for them to earn money. Every other search engine did it. So why can't google do it? They had never accepted it: a simple white page with a search input was enough for them. It's really important to be creative and do what others are not doing or think is wrong doing so, to distinguish yourself from others. Not necessarily because others are wrong, but by doing differently, you provide new ways of doing things. If you're not creative, you're not hacking.

3. Doing differently requires training. It's not by being opposed to others all the time. It's by evaluating and questioning all the time and by asking yourself why things are done in such a way. And if you don't have a clear answer, you need to study it deeply. The best way of learning how you can do things differently is by reading books, so that you can deeply understand the cultural background in which we live: the way things are done today are very relative to our culture, to our way of living. So by studying and understanding that things can be done in many different ways, you free yourself from dogmatic backgrounds.

4. Climb on the top of the roof. Do not question so much the tools, the technologies provided today. If they exist, and are here in our ordinary life massively, it means that they provide great service for humanity. Just see what you can build with them. If google is providing you great AI services for example, do take this opportunity. If youtube helps you to learn new things, take it very seriously and see what you can create out of it. Do not rebuild the wheel. But see what we can do with the wheels of today.

5. Take into consideration the values of others. Hacking doesn't need to be done alone. You can bring others with you, by showing them new ways of playing. Also consider and take seriously the differences that others are showing to you. If you see others behaving in new ways, be curious, and see what you can learn from them. 

6. Distinguish yourself from the rules I just proposed to you :)
