Kotlin is a statically typed open source programming language created by the people at JetBrains (formerly IntelliJ Software s.r.o.). The name comes from Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg. It runs on the Java/JVM 32-bit virtual machine platform runtime code (compiling into Java bytecode), but also compiles to JavaScript (the current implementation of Kotlin/JS targets ES5) and you can also write apps that work in iOS as well. 

For the moment, kotlin is primarily being used for android. Google estimated that 70% of the top 1000 apps on the Play Store are written in Kotlin. Google itself has 60 apps written in Kotlin, including Maps and Drive.
