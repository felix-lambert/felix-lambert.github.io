- [Kotlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language))

Kotlin is a statically types open source programming language. The name comes from the Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg. It runs on the Java/JVM virtual machine platform runtime code (compiling into Java bytecode), but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React) or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps, and you can also write apps that works in ios as well. 

The JVM is fundamentally a 32-bit machine. 

For the moment, kotlin is primarly being used for android. Google estimating that 70% of the top 1000 apps on the Play Store are written in Kotlin. Google itself has 60 apps written in Kotlin, including Maps and Drive. It's a language created by the people at JetBrains (formerly IntelliJ Software s.r.o.).
