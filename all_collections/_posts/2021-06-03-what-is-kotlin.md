- [Kotlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language))

Kotlin is a statically types open source programming language. It runs on the Java/JVM virtual machine platform runtime code, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React) or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps, but you can also write apps that works in ios as well. For the moment, kotlin is primarly being used for android. Google estimating that 70% of the top 1000 apps on the Play Store are written in Kotlin. Google itself has 60 apps written in Kotlin, including Maps and Drive. It's a language created by the people at JetBrains.
