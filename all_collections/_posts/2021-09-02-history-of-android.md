The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras, and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April 2004. The company then decided that the market for cameras was not large enough for its goals, and five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as a handset operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile.

The Apple App store was launched on 10 July 2008 with 500 apps. The Google Play Store, which was originally known as the Android Market was launched on 22 October 2008.

The main hardware platform for Android is ARM (the ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures), with x86 and x86-64 architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android.

Android is Open Source but is not Linux in the traditional Unix-like Linux distribution sense; Android does not include the GNU C Library (it uses Bionic as an alternative C library) and some other components typically found in Linux distributions. Android's standard C library, Bionic, was developed by Google specifically for Android, as a derivation of the BSD's standard C library code. Bionic itself has been designed with several major features specific to the Linux kernel. The main benefits of using Bionic instead of the GNU C Library (glibc) or uClibc are its smaller runtime footprint, and optimization for low-frequency CPUs.

In contrast to desktop Linux distributions, Android device owners are not given root access to the operating system and sensitive partitions such as /system/ are read-only. However, root access can be obtained by exploiting security flaws in Android, which is used frequently by the open-source community to enhance the capabilities and customizability of their devices, but also by malicious parties to install viruses and malware.

On top of the Linux kernel, there are the middleware, libraries and APIs written in C, and application software running on an application framework which includes Java-compatible libraries. 

Matthew Panzarino, co-editor of TechCrunch, believes that there are three phases of app history in mobile technology.

1/ The initial gaming and utilities apps available in mobiles. This was seen in early PDAs and the first-generation iPhone. 

2/ Apps that were focused around grabbing the user's attention and dominating the mobile home screen. 

3/ Today's phase in which apps are service layers, purpose built and utilise technology such as hardware sensors, location, history of use and predictive computation.
