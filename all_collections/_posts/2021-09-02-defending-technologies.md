It's really difficult to find thinkers defending new technologies of today. They seem to not notice that technology offers a huge service for humans. A service that could help them to become more human. Even with thinkers I really appreciate, they nearly always end up saying that technology, with capitalism I suppose, will, by one way or another, end up destroying humanity. It's always the same kind of love song.

Some examples:
Bill Gates: "Artificial Intelligence is a threat"
Elon Musk: "With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon"

We also criticize google helping us with our spelling mistakes in english for example, or suggesting some answers, not enabling us to think for ourselves. But google might work so well for humans, because this functionality is actually a great help for us: if we feel lazy answering, google can motivate us by giving us this fast answer, which is more polite. If we don't approve, these new functionalities, we are not forced to accept them. We can decide to leave gmail for example. But we don't really, because I think it's for a good reason.

The technophobe is fascinated by the end of humanity, destroyed by technology, while the technophile is fascinated by the tools of technology while neglecting its purpose (reducing suffering for example).

The technology is now part of us. It's part of our humanity. And it's through these technologies that we can act in the world. So the problem is not AI, it is questioning what is the end goal of AI for example. I use AI or pseudo AI technologies every day and it's really cool to use them. I'm not afraid of them if they can help me in fulfilling my project: writing good emails with no grammar mistakes, translating a paper into corean, helping us to detect potential dangers... If it's only used for ads, well it's a very disappointing use of AI I guess. So maybe we need to ask our intellectual friends to focus on where we need to go as a human species with all the technologies that are around us. But the difficulty is to take time in understanding first what these technologies are and to which extent they can help us building a more sustainable society with maybe a new set of cultural background.
