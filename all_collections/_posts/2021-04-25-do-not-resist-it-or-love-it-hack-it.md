- [Hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture)

<em>"The hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of software systems to achieve novel and clever outcomes"</em>

When a new thing is coming to you, or when something needs to change, the first reaction might be resistance or blockage. Or we can admire this new thing, without any critical thinking. But we can deal with it differently. We can see if we can accept it. And if it does not completely fit our values or our needs, you can hack it.

So what I'm proposing is that we don't really need to be completely against google, video games, nation states, or capitalism... We can try to find out what we can do with those ideals, understand what are their core values, and behave in such ways that we can generate small change. In other words, we can hack these systems so that new opportunities can arise. Even in the world of apps, with google and apple owning these industries, we can create new types of apps, change the goals and behavior of apps, so that even google or apple could'nt anticipate with what we can do with them. Linux hacked computers to transform them into operating systems. The Internet and the web, hacked microsoft, to transform the computer into a connected device. And even in the offline life, when change happens, it's often because of something creative happening. We tend to idealize revolutions, but when real change happens, it's often because of a new behavior with new individuals that are seeing things in new ways. We can evaluate here the current situation and see that new ways of relating with things can arize.
