- [Hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture)

<em>"The hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of software systems to achieve novel and clever outcomes"</em>

When a new thing is coming to you, or when something needs to change, the first reaction might be resistance or blockage. Or we can admire this new thing, without any critical thinking. But we can deal with it differently. We can see if we can accept it. And if it does not completely fit our values or our needs, we can hack it.So what I’m proposing is that we don’t really need to be completely against google, video games, nation states, or capitalism… We can try to find out what we can do with those ideals, understand their core values, and behave in such ways that we can generate small change. In other words, we can hack these systems so that new opportunities can arise. Even in the world of apps, with google and apple owning these industries, we can create new types of apps, change the goals and behavior of apps, so that even google or apple couldn't anticipate what we can do with them. Linux hacked computers to transform them into operating systems. The Internet and the web, hacked microsoft, to the operating system into a connected device. And even in offline life, when change happens, it’s often because of something creative happening. We tend to idealize revolutions, but when real change happens, it’s often because of a new behavior with new individuals that are seeing things in new ways. We can evaluate the current situation and see that new ways of relating with things and people can arise.

But how to hack?

1. Evaluate zones that are not totally blocked. So hacking politics, facebook, the nuclear industry, or closed ideologies could be a big waste of energy with a big wall with no holes facing you… What you could hack, is things that are actually open to hacking, by being aware of things that are in dynamic movement. Hacking is letting things move, with no blockage. If there is violence in the world or closed ideology, it’s because there is blockage and no movement. So hacking could be letting things move as they should move.

2. Do things differently. Do not really listen to what should be done to start a business for example, or gather users. It's really important to be creative and do what others are not doing or think is wrong doing so, to distinguish yourself from others. Not necessarily because others are wrong, but by doing differently, you provide new ways of doing things. If you're not creative, you're not hacking.
