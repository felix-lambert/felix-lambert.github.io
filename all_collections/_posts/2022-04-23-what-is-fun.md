If we decide to have fun and play with all the world in front of us, we can make peace with all the things that are around us. 

<em>"We are obsessed with freedom, but we are also miserable and bored, despite living in an era of enormous
surplus. Instead of seeing freedom as an escape from the chains of limitation, we should interpret it as an
opportunity to explore the implications of inherited or invented limitations."</em> Bogost
