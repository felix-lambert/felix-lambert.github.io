Perceiving new technologies as solely threatening might serve as an excuse to turn to ideologies (religious, political, etc.) from the past. Some individuals may encourage fear towards new technologies, as they unconsciously perceive the potential loss of control that these technologies could bring.

A washing machine grants women independence, freeing them from the task of laundering their family's clothes by the river. A refrigerator empowers households to store food and prepare a wide variety of meals at home. A smartphone enables individuals to access any information they need within seconds, without relying on "experts".

Technology has become an integral part of our lives, shaping our humanity and enabling us to act in the world.
