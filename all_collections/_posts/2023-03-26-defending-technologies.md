Michel Puech, a French philosopher, believes that perceiving new technologies as solely threatening might serve as an excuse to turn to ideologies (religious, political, etc.) from the past. Why do intellectuals tend to criticize new technologies, or even view them as a threat? It's because one of the primary benefits that technology offers to humans is autonomy.

Some individuals may encourage fear towards new technologies, as they unconsciously perceive the potential loss of control and influence that these technologies could bring. It is crucial to recognize such tendencies and embrace the potential of our modern world to improve our lives and address challenges. By understanding the benefits of technology without succumbing to fear, we can harness its full potential in a responsible manner, fostering autonomy and empowerment for all.

A washing machine grants women independence, freeing them from the task of laundering their family's clothes by the river. A refrigerator empowers households to store food and prepare a wide variety of meals at home. A smartphone enables individuals to access any information they need within seconds, without relying on "experts."

Technology has become an integral part of our lives, shaping our humanity and enabling us to act in the world. The real issue is not AI itself, but rather understanding the ultimate goals and purposes behind its development. Personally, I utilize AI and pseudo-AI technologies on a daily basis, as long as they help me achieve my goals, such as writing emails with good grammar, or translating papers. However, if AI is solely utilized for advertising and control, it would be a disappointing use of its potential. Perhaps it is time for our intellectual community to focus on where we, as a human species, should be heading with these technologies. But the challenge is first to critically examine what these technologies are and how they can contribute to the creation of a more sustainable society with a new set of cultural background.
