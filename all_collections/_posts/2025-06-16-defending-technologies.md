Perceiving new technologies as solely threatening might serve as an excuse to turn to ideologies (religious, political, etc.) from the past. Some individuals may encourage fear towards new technologies, as they unconsciously perceive the potential loss of control that these technologies could bring.

A washing machine grants women independence, freeing them from the task of laundering their family's clothes by the river. A refrigerator empowers households to store food and prepare a wide variety of meals at home. A smartphone enables individuals to access any information they need within seconds, without relying on "experts".

As people embrace these tools, they increasingly act in ways that support individual agency and refuse centralized control. The more society aligns with the ideals of a technological civilization, the harder it becomes for authoritarian systems to maintain dominance.
