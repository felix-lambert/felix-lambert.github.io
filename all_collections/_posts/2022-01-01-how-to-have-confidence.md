- [Daoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism)

Having confidence is having a good perception of the energies surrounding you. To try to be a bit more poetic, we need to feel the flow of the river guiding you. This energy could be some kind of movement, perhaps the qi or the dao in Asian culture. We need to let it liberate you from blockage without interfering with the energy of others. Domination is maybe a sort of energy disconnected from yourself that is not letting others liberating their own energy. You don't need to be in total opposition with this energy of domination, but let your own energy move in a different direction.
