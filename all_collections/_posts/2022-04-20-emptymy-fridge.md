Humans need to change and act in order to solve the problems linked to the Anthropocene, but we cannot. Scientists are alerting us to the dangers of accelerating biodiversity loss. We are aware of it, we know what to do and how to do it, but we do nothing. There is a certain form of inertia to action.

So let's start by trying to change in an essential area in order to begin to take charge of ourselves: the kitchen. How do you force yourself to cook, take care of your health, and in particular stop throwing away?

1/3 of the food produced in the world is never consumed and 61% of this non-consumed food comes from households while nearly 690,000,000 people suffer from hunger or malnutrition. Some say you can find a link between the way you cook at home and access to food in poor countries. This waste represents an expense of 159 euros per person per year in France. It is an aberration.

To change, we can use technologies to self-discipline us. But we must already begin by questioning the common belief of today.

The smartphone and its applications, even though it was created by a large multinational in 2007, is in fact a brilliant tool, truly revolutionary and which has worked incredibly well. The Internet, the mobile phone for example, has made human civilization evolve, but perhaps the smartphone is the culmination of the implementation of this evolution, because mobile applications today offer the tools for autonomy through play (the name of the app distribution android service is called the Play Store). If you have a smartphone next to you, it's probable that an appplication is already opened or ready to be used. This is why humans today attach enormous importance to the smartphone, which is always present, next to us (physically, in space, but also psychologically). 

We are now entering a new phase in the development of mobile applications. The first phases are as follows:

1 We develop apps that just focus on grabbing the user's attention and dominating the mobile home screen

2 We develop applications that use AIs tool to predict and influence the behavior of the user

3 We are now entering a phase where we are developing increasingly fun applications that support users to help them on a daily basis: a French application such as TooGoodToGo, for example, helps merchants to fight against food waste, while gaining money. This company is developing very quickly in Europe and the United States

However, today there is a certain distrust of new technologies and this is perhaps all the more true among groups sensitive to the problems of the Anthropocene. The digital world, in its infancy, could give rise to hope. But 95% of the time, when we decide to download an application we are disappointed. We are annoyed to have ads, unnecessary surveillance, with a long form to fill out (otherwise we cannot use the application) to finally come across nothing useful, not to mention the spam emails we will be forced to filter or promotional notifications that are not unchecked by default. A paywall can also fall on us after a few minutes.

This environment is painful because we lose time, concentration and we enter more easily into a phase of distraction, which prevents us from moving forward on our individual or collective projects.

So aren't all these new apps basically gadgets that just make us addicted to screens, and that still take a few minutes of our time, a few megabytes of our data, or a few euros of our money under excuse to do ecology? And why are app creators so tempted by a paternalistic form of marketing? Several hypotheses:

1 They are looking to make a quick profit

2 They haven't built a real culture around these new apps

3 It is the technical architecture of mobile applications which in itself imposes a "top - down" logic of the "server - client"

I think there is a bit of truth to 1 but maybe it has to do with something deeper, which I believe is produced by 2. Mobile apps must indeed thrive in a peaceful gaming environment that makes it possible to offer users the right dispositions to act.

I released in the "stores" for a year an application that helps to cook easily with the ingredients that we already have at home. I list seasonal fruits and vegetables and I set up a virtual fridge with an algorithm that allows you to select the 25 best recipes based on the ingredients in this fridge. You can also share this virtual fridge with anyone to synchronize recipes, ingredients, best recipes and shopping list. Advantages: we motivate ourselves more easily to cook, and we prefer to consume what we have rather than going to the supermarket.

A fridge is a very sophisticated device that allows you to keep a large amount of food a little longer. Without an application, without technological help, it is in fact difficult to find benchmarks, fun rules, to manage your fridge. It is difficult to have the expertise to know what to cook, when, for cheap, and without throwing anything away.

It is true that from time to time it is comforting to go out a little, or to order a good prepared meal online in front of a good movie. I do too. But if we completely lose control of the fridge, if we don't act, little or badly, on the fridge, we lose money and that results in waste. So there's something quite deep going on when you throw away a pot of expired yogurt instead of enjoying it in a nice tikka masala that's probably more serious than just wasting money.

There are tons of alternatives to what I offer, which not only saves waste, but also allows you to gain autonomy by cooking for yourself. It is possible to consult recipe sites, to make dishes that we appreciate and that we already know. It is even possible to be creative, by mixing ingredients that you like, without necessarily following a particular recipe.

Being a cooking enthusiast myself, I tried all these solutions. But our memory is limited even for a good chef. If, on the other hand, we have before our eyes a panorama of the best recipes according to what we have at home, it stimulates our thinking, our imagination, our creativity and our motivation through play. This is the first step for action.

In my field of tech, engineers can sometimes only be fascinated by what they do, i.e. code, and end up neglecting the end user. We basically have a little trouble understanding users, what they are looking for when they decide to download. I already wish that we try to forget the top-down communication with a "no-reply" as an email address: if we build the application with the users, and by collaborating with other applications, we leave server-client logic. I want to build this application with the users so that we can move forward together to create new features.
