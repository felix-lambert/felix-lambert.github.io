It's really difficult to find thinkers who advocate for the technologies of today. They seem to not notice that technology offers a huge service for humans. Even the thinkers I really appreciate, they almost always end up saying that technology, with capitalism I suppose, will, by one way or another, end up destroying humanity. It's always the same kind of love song.
 
Michel Puech, a French philosopher, thinks that seeing only threats in new technologies may be a pretext to ask help from ideologies (religious, political...) of the past. Why do thinkers tend to only criticize new technologies, or even, consider them as a threat? Because the first thing that technologies can provide to humans is autonomy. A washing machine provides autonomy to women - liberating them from washing clothes of the family by the river. A fridge provides autonomy to the household that can now stock their food and cook an enormous diversity of meals at home. A smartphone gives autonomy to humans: they can get all the information they need in a few seconds and not ask anything to "experts".

Technologies can liberate us as they help us to become autonomous. And seeing new technologies as a threat implies that we are not comfortable with the values of autonomy. We might prefer the values of vulnerability that give the rooms for domination and control.
 
Technology is now part of us. It's part of our humanity. And it's through these technologies that we can act in the world. So the problem is not AI, but it is questioning what is the end goal of AI. I use AI or pseudo AI technologies every day. I'm not afraid of them if they can help me in fulfilling my project: writing good emails with no grammar mistakes, translating a paper into Korean, helping us to detect potential dangers... If it's only used for ads and control, well it's a very disappointing use of AI I guess. So maybe we need to ask our intellectual friends to focus on where we need to go as a human species with all the technologies that are around us. But the difficulty is first to question what these technologies are and to what extent they can help us build a more sustainable society with maybe a new set of cultural backgrounds.
