It's accepted to say that in the buddhist tradition we all have a potential buddha inside of us. I wonder if we cannot say the same thing for things. Maybe a nice game could be to find out in each persons the ethics inside of them. We can also realize that things can have some ethics too: if you listen well to a table, it's here to be cleaned sometimes, and to have some nice food prepared in top of it. If you see a shower and soap, it's here to be used well. The soap is telling you to wash yourself properly and all the cleaning products are telling you to clean your house. If you listen and realize that things are actually communicating things to you, and you can react to it, you might discover a real guidance in your life.
