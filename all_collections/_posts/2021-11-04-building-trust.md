I think as an individual the hard job is to build trust around us. But it's also trusting others. The digital age gives us to share all our feelings and thoughts to the humanity. I think we should celebrate this evolution: people are not insecure to share their ideas and photos or videos to the world, and often for free. So gathering billions of data is not really a problem if in return companies can provide constructive help to all of us. 

The problem comes when in exchange a company like facebook uses this data so that they receive money from private companies that try to manipulate us with publicity or to rig an election. In this context these actions are lowering the level of trust in the society.
