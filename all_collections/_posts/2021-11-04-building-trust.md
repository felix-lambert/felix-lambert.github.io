I think as an individual the hard job is to build trust around you. But it's also trusting others. If we see the evolution of the digital age we can see that the society evolves because we use private companies to order taxis, to rent with airbnb, or we are ready to share all our data and our private life to a company like facebook. I think we should celebrate this evolution of people not being insecured to share their ideas and some photos or videos to the world, and often for free. So gathering billions of data is not really a problem if in return companies can provide constructive help to everyone of us. 

The problem comes when in exchange a company like facebook use this data so that they receive money from private companies that tries to manipulate us with publicity or to rig an election. In this context these actions are lowering the level of trust in the society.
