<em>"The hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of software systems to achieve novel and clever outcomes"</em>

Linux hacked computers to transform them into operating systems. The Internet and the web, hacked microsoft, and transformed the computer from an operating system to a connected device. And even in offline life, when change happens, it’s often because of something creative happening. We tend to idealize revolutions, but when real change happens, it’s often because of a new behavior with individuals that can improvise by seeing things in new ways. The energy of change in this behavior can create a new wave of behavior. We can evaluate the current situation and see that new ways of relating with objects and people can arise.
