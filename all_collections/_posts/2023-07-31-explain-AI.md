Embedding > Way of converting something, like a word or an image, into a series of numbers that a computer can understand and work with. This is also called vector. Think of it like turning a word into a coordinate on a map. Each word gets its own unique position, and similar words are placed close together. This allows the computer to understand the relationships between words, like "cat" and "kitten" being similar, so they would be close together on the map. This numerical representation can capture complex relationships between words, such as their meaning, grammar, and context.

Finetune > Refers to a process of adjusting a Language Model (LM) to make it better at a specific task or within a specific domain.

GPU > Graphics Processing Unit. GPUs are often used to speed up the training of models, allowing researchers and developers to experiment more quickly and efficiently.

GPT > Stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer".

Here's a breakdown of what each part means in a very simple way:

Generative: It can generate text, like writing sentences or stories.
Pre-trained: It has already learned a lot from reading lots of text before you even ask it anything.
Transformer: Helps the computer understand patterns in the text like grammar and meaning.

GPT is like a smart text-writing machine that has read lots of books and websites, and can use what it learned to write new text or answer questions.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) were initially designed for rendering graphics, where many pixels must be processed simultaneously. Each pixel's color can be computed independently of the others, so this task is highly parallelizable. The architecture of a GPU is optimized to perform the same operation on many data points simultaneously. This parallel processing is well-suited to the type of computations needed for training deep learning models, where the same operation is often performed on many data points at once. CPUs are more optimized for sequential processing, where tasks are done one after another. Some modern CPUs have features specifically designed to improve performance on machine learning tasks, narrowing the gap between CPUs and GPUs in some cases.

Template > Often refers to a specific structure or pattern used to guide the generation of text. It's a powerful way to control the format of the output and can be particularly useful when integrating AI-generated text into applications that require consistent and specific formatting.

Tokenization > is the process of breaking up a piece of text into smaller parts called "tokens." These tokens are often individual words, but they can also be smaller units like syllables or even single characters. Imagine you have a sentence like "I love ice cream." Tokenization would break this sentence into individual tokens: "I", "love", "ice", "cream". In the context of natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis, tokenization is a crucial first step because it allows computers to understand and work with human language. By breaking text down into smaller parts, it becomes easier to analyze the structure, meaning, and other linguistic features of the text.

Vector database > A vector database is a specialized type of database that stores and manages vectors. In this context, a vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers, and it often represents things like words or images in a format that a machine learning model can understand.
